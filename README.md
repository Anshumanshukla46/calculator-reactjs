# Here are some key concepts for making a calculator in ReactJS:

# Components: 
Like any ReactJS application, a calculator will require multiple components for different parts of the interface, such as buttons, display, and so on.

# State Management: 
In ReactJS, state management is typically done using the "useState" hook. You will need to define the state variables for your calculator, such as the current input, the result of the calculation, and so on.

# Event Handling: 
To handle user interactions, such as clicking on a button, you will need to define event handlers for your components. These event handlers will update the state variables based on the user input.

# Calculation Logic: 
To perform calculations, you will need to implement the logic for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You can use JavaScript's built-in math functions or write your own logic.

# Styling: 
To make your calculator visually appealing, you will need to style your components using CSS or a CSS preprocessor like SASS. You can use inline styles, CSS modules, or a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material UI to style your components.

# Accessibility: 
It's important to ensure that your calculator is accessible to users with different abilities. This can include providing alternative text for images, using semantic HTML, and ensuring that the interface is navigable using keyboard inputs.

## Overall, building a calculator in ReactJS involves understanding how to create and manage components, handle state and events, implement calculation logic, render components, style components, and ensure accessibility.
